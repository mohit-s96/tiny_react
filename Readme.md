# tiny react

#### minimal react reconciler and dom renderer implementation.

#### This is a project I built for learning more about react. I started making this after reading this [blog](https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/) on how to create your own react, but made many changes of my own like writing in typescript and supporting more features.

This version currently supports

- concurrent mode
- only rendering parts of tree which were changed
- hooks
- useEffect
- useState
- controlled input components

## examples

there is an examples folder where i used this for making simple apps. here is a live [link](https://msx47.github.io/tiny_react/)

## more

this is a learning project for me and I plan to add new things as I learn more about react internals.
